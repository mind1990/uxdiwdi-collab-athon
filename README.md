<h1>Panthera</h1>
A two day collabathon where I was tasked to create a responsive website with three UX designers. The concept project was for a pet store that showcased a newsletter feature and focused on company branding.



<h2>Technologies used</h2>
<ul>
  <li>HTML</li>
  <li>CSS</li>
  <li>MailChimp</li>
</ul>
<h2>Process/Approach</h2>
The designers and I talked about the user story and experience, then we moved on to wireframing which we helped each other on designing the web pages. After we had desiged our website, I moved on to coding while the designers helped me do research on some codes tha I couldn't figure out. 

<h2>Unsolved Problems</h2>
We wanted to have some animations and also the website to be more responsive.

<h2>Biggest Wins/Challenges</h2>
<h3>Wins</h3>
After many tries and fails I was able to make my website to be responsive using Flexbox and deployed it using Firebase.
<h3>Challenges</h3>
I was having a hard time deciding how should my website look and what features to implement since this is out first project.

<h2>Planned Implementation</h2>
I'm planning to rebuild this website using React and also style it with Sass.
